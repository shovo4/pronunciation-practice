# Pronunciation Practice App (IlmHub)
The Pronunciation Practice App is a web app that helps users practice their pronunciation of Arabic using the Tashkeel (diacritics) and the Arabic alphabet found in the Quran. This app was built for use by the IlmHub organization with the aim of helping young children (k-8) learn and practice their pronunciation of the Quran. The app is built using the Django framework and is hosted on Heroku. The app is currently in development.

## Usage
### Student
- To login, or if you forget your user credentials, contact your teacher for your login username and password
- Once logged in, select any chapter box from the home page coloured yellow to view lessons that have been `assigned` to you that are not yet complete
    - Listen to the audio for a lesson by pressing the 'play' button to the left of the lesson text, then repeat the pronunciation back to yourself
    - Listening to a lesson once will decrease the `repetitions` counter by 1; once it reaches 0, the lesson will be marked as `completed` and your teacher will be notified that you are ready to be tested on the pronunciation at your next in-person meeting
    - `Completed` lessons can still be practiced as much as required even if you've listened to the lesson for the set number of repetitions
- If your teacher is satisfied with your pronunciation of an assigned lesson after testing you on it, they will mark the lesson as `confirmed`
    - If your teacher beleives you need more practice, they will re-assign the lesson to you, and it will appear as an `unfinished` lesson the next time you log in
- If there are no yellow `unfinished` chapters on your home page, you can still practice any lesson by navigating to its associated chapter
    - To view how many lessons are currently assigned to you and how many lessons you've completed, select the user icon in the top right of the screen
- When you are done with your session, select the user icon in the top right of the screen and click the `log out` button to end your session

### Teacher
- To log in to your account for the first time, contact your site admin for login credentials
- Once logged in, select a student from the `students` dropdown in the menubar, or view all your student's progress at once from the home page
    - From either of these pages, you can assign a student a new lesson and the number of repetitions they must listen to the lesson audio for before it is marked as `completed` by navigating to the appropriate lesson tab and chapter for the lesson, then using the `assign` button on the right of the lesson text to assign the lesson to the current student
    - Selecting the `assign all lessons` button at the bottom of each chapter will assign all the lessons in a chapter to the specified student for the set number of repetitions
    - You can also unassign individual lessons from a student if they have been assigned incorrectly using the `unassign` button to the right of the lesson text
    - The `students` dropdown will also show the number of unfinished and finished lessons for each student, allowing you to see which student's require more work at a glance
- When assigning lessons, you can `assign` both new lessons that the student hasn't seen yet, or `reassign` lesson that the student has already `completed` but has not practiced enough to pass the in-person test for that lesson
- If a student's lesson is marked yellow, they have been assigned the lesson but are still practicing it
    - If the lesson is marked red, the student hasn't been assigned the lesson yet and can't view it from their account until you assign it to them
    - If the lesson is marked blue, the student has `completed` the lesson but has yet to be tested on it
- When a student's pronunciation of a `completed` lesson is tested in-person, you can mark the lesson as `confirmed` if their pronunciation is acceptable
    - This will mark the lesson green, indicating that the student has passed the test for that lesson
    - If the pronunciation of the lesson is not acceptable, you can `re-assign` the lesson with a set number of repetitions to colour the lesson yellow and re-add it to the student's list of `unfinished` lessons

    - To view a detailed list of your child's progress for a given chapter, select the desired chapter box from the home page
- For a given chapter, `unfinished` lessons are marked in yellow, lessons your child has `completed` will be marked in blue, and lessons your child has finished and been tested on will be marked in blue as `confirmed` by their teacher
- Clicking the `children` dropdown on the menubar will allow you to view an indiviual child's progress
